# AWS-MFA-Multi-Factor-Authentication

## Summary

### **AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  

AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enhances security by requiring users to provide an additional authentication factor beyond their password. This extra layer of security helps protect AWS accounts from unauthorized access.  

#### **How It Works:**  
âœ… Users sign in with their password (first factor)  
âœ… They provide a time-based OTP (second factor) from an MFA device (e.g., Authenticator app, hardware key)  
âœ… Access is granted only after both factors are verified  

#### **Benefits of AWS MFA:**  
ðŸ”¹ Strengthens account security against credential theft  
ðŸ”¹ Prevents unauthorized access, even if passwords are compromised  
ðŸ”¹ Supports virtual, hardware, and FIDO security keys
